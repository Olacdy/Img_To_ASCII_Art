## Description

This simple script allows you to convert any image to ASCII art with characters that you can specify too. There are two ways to use this app:
- You can load image through file explorer and get output in form of text file and image of result.
- You can open your webcamera and see transformation live, although its a bit slow with a live transformation, so there is some work needs to be done.
